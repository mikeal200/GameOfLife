# GameOfLife

The goal of this project is to design a visualization of the Game of Life as
described by John Horton Conway.1 The Game of Life was meant to show what
happens to organisms when they are placed in close proximity to each other.
Upon giving the Game initial conditions, each successive ‘generation’ (iteration)
shows the evolution of the organisms. The Game is represented on a grid of
squares with colored squares denoting a living organism.
